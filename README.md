# Aishu's Archive

this is where I track my media consumption. From Books, Movies, TV, Music and More! 

I wanted to have a really cool and fun you that was reminiscent of the old internet! Feel free to clone this and make you own personalized media archive. 


The project uses:
- HTML/CSS for the frontend
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Supabase for backend (database, auth, storage)
- Python's HTTP server for local development
